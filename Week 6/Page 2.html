        <h1>Background Information</h1>
        <br />
            <p>I was born in Red Lodge, Montana.</p>
            <p>With beautiful scenery all around me, I was inspired constantly.</p>
            <p>A lot of the art I created is inspired by nature.</p>
            <p>Since going to the University of Montana I've been trying to broaden my horizons.</p>
            <p>Below are a few pieces I've made throughout the years.</p>
